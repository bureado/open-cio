# Navigating today's open source landscape

With more and more organizations of all shapes and sizes around the world looking at open source to accelerate their digital transformation journeys, open source industry trends are becoming front and central for CTOs, CIOs and IT leadership in general.

In fact, CIOs attitude towards open source has changed dramatically over the last few years. Analysts, including Forrester Research, as well as influencers have covered how open source has become the new normal in enterprise software.

Joseph Jacks' open source company index, covering 28 companies with an average age of 12 years that are capturing over $6B in VC funding and collectively valuated at $80B, and it's very likely most organizations have dealings with one or many of the companies in that index, or large cloud vendors that work with open source technologies themselves.

## What has changed?

For open source practitioners and enthusiasts who are already in the IT value chain, this isn't surprising. However, we also recognize how we keep up with news in the open source industry has changed. The places and mechanisms we used to stay up-to-date, from IRC, mailing lists, forums and blog planets to conferences or books haven't really gone away but on top of that we've added social sources (Reddit, LinkedIn and Twitter), news aggregators like Hacker News, many new media outlets, analysts and influencers, and dynamic sources like YouTube, Slack or Telegram.

So the question is - how can CIOs have a continuously informed viewpoint on what's happening on the open source industry? There are many entities the CIO interacts with that hold pieces of the answer. Their own developers and practitioners are the first line. If they're a big organization with an Open Source Programs Office, they might hold part of the answer, too. And certainly vendors are increasingly bringing this into the conversations with IT.

While some of these components of the IT value chain might hold partial answers to the questions of how we use, integrate or release/contribute to open source, the CIO is ultimately accountable for answering the question why we do open source to begin with.

## A 3-step approach

We propose a simple 3-step approach for CIOs:

1. Stay informed
2. Sponsor your community
3. Bring open into your value chain: community, vendors, priorities

Most organizations are already doing some of these things, particularly around hosting meetups or internal hackathons. However, community is more than buying pizza for the meetup: CIOs are going to be expected to bring skin in the game including showing a working feedback cycle for the community.

We also contend that the organizational *attitude* towards open source complements the organizational *policy* towards open source. This *attitude* is what sends a clear message upstream and downstream the value chain that the IT organization is serious about bringing open source into it.

## Keeping up

The pace of innovation in open source has made any ad-hoc effort to keep up ineffective. There are very good efforts out there to simplify the changing landscape for the enterprise. A good example is the ThoughtWorks' Radar.

Over a period of about 3 years, we've processed thousands of news items on open source trends in the cloud, platform, data, infrastructure, container and other spaces. Over 40% of the finds were from social media (including valuable community sentiment from the discussion) although many sources like Lxer, Hacker News, Linux Today, Lobste.rs and outlets like The New Stack and The Register continue to be valuable.

We've proposed a simple tool to codify a series of questions and answers on a given open source meme or trend so organizations can track their priorities over time. Based on the lean canvas model, we've called this the Open Source Flashcanvas.
