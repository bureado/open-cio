# Gathering open source intelligence

## Firehose

We put together an [RSS feed](https://aka.ms/opencloudfeed) including select open source news with a cloud flair. It's hard to keep up, but with some other resources in this repository including automated summaries and text classification, it might be easier. But you shouldn't get paralyzed by too much information. Your favorite media outlet, podcast or Twitter account might offer a selection of news and that could very well be enough for your business.

Aggregators like Hacker News are a good idea to follow. We've found that [lobste.rs])(http://lobste.rs/) is actually a good predictor of open source items that make it to the front page in Hacker News. It's important to understand that certain events or moments in a year might drive the conversation, particularly events.

## Conferences

Even if you're not attending a conference, there's a lot you can learn from it. First of all, you can see who the sponsors and organizers are. You can see if any customers are being showcased on stage. You can also go through the schedule and see who the presenters are and their affiliation. From that you can also derive production use cases. This works for big conferences as well as small ones too.

There are many event calendars out there. Some good hubs include [PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/events), [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=open%20source), [ItCfp](https://github.com/softwaremill/it-cfp-list) as well as Lanyrd or Meetup, and you should also check out the official calendars over at [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/conferences-and-events-monthly).

## Social

Some subreddits, notably /r/linux, provide solid commentary on many technical trends although, like with all social sources, the samples are often biased. A particularly interesting source of information are polls (surveys) ran by select influencers on Twitter ([example](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=from%3Anixcraft%20poll&src=typd)) and it's also worth mentioning that certain podcasts are also good sources of intelligence depending on the guests and/or content covered (some podcasts, like The Changelog, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thechangelog/ping/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) for people pitching to them)
