# Introduction to the Open Source Flashcanvas

This is a simple tool designed to help organizations assess the actual or potential impact of a trend in the open source industry.

Borrowing from the concept and spirit of simplification of [lean canvas](https://blog.leanstack.com/why-lean-canvas-vs-business-model-canvas-af62c0f250f0), the *flashcanvas* seeks to generate flashcards that succintly answer key questions to assess the impact of trends of interest.

## Audience

The *flashcanvas* should be able to be presented to the IT decision makers (CIO and other executives) of any organization, whether in the software industry or not.

## Authoring

The process of curating and maintaining the *flashcanvas* should be an open and collaborative one. For example, you might want to consider storing each *flashcanvas* in a library or wiki accessible by the organization, and maintaining the *flashcanvas* under source control.

This can be fundamental to ensure broad organizational support to the goals and measures of success as defined in the *flashcanvas*.

## Sections

The *flashcanvas* is divided in three sections:

1. Why IT cares: problem description, definition of success and business perspective
2. What the trend/meme is about: value proposition, competing actors and success factors for them and market traction/sense of urgency
3. Questions: how should the CIO inspect upstream and downstream to keep a pulse on this trend

A PNG version of the flashcanvas is available [TBD](), with an automated tool to convert from Markdown into canvas coming soon.

## Inputs

### Trends

There are two main sources for identifying trends of interest. The first one is the continuous inspection of the [firehose](https://aka.ms/opencloudfeed) (see [TBD]()) and the second one is a list of prioritized trends that come from a strategic exercise such as war games or a consulting engagement.

The main difference between both approaches is that the firehose doesn't come with an initial impact assessment and prioritization recommendations. In [TBD]() we offer a number of recommendations for IT organizations to cope with the firehose.

### Answers

The next step is to find out the answers to the questions posed in the [Sections](#Sections) chapter. 

Media and analyst coverage (particularly over time) as well as intelligence obtained from social networks, careful examination of conference and session content, etc., should help answer most of the questions in the *What this meme is about* section.

The *Why IT cares* section is industry- and organization-specific. Most organizations will either have foundational business goals that all technology and vendors in the IT value chain need to deliver, or will derive specifics based on industry best practices.

In some cases, there might be forums to grab from, like the [Symphony Foundation](http://blog.symphony.foundation/open-source-readiness-in-the-financial-services-industry-1) for financial services, or [Open Health News](http://www.openhealthnews.com/) for health care, but the answers to this section should ultimately be unique to the organization that will consume the *flashcanvas*.

For the *Questions* section we offer high-level guidance in the [TBD]() document.

When the business problem of a particular open source trend is of an actual open source nature (e.g., related to contributing to open source projects) it might be worth keeping in mind high-level introductory questions on [contributions](https://twitter.com/ibrahimatlinux/status/939259797618044928) and [project health](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics).
