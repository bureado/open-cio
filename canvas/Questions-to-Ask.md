# Questions to ask

The Open Source Flashcanvas has an entire section devoted to asking question to your value chain. The value chain includes external vendors, members of the IT department, your internal community and beyond.

In this article, we describe some common questions to ask about a particular meme or trend in the open source industry to provoke a discussion around its impact. This isn't a checklist or a comprehensive list of questions to ask. Every organization will have their own, and contributions are welcome.

## For your community

* How do we show up in this community? Do we have people contributing? Do we have people asking or answering questions?
* How do we keep a pulse on this community? Do we understand its health metrics? Do we understand who are driving the project? Do we understand how the project is driven?
* Have we run a proof-of-concept for this technology? Have we benchmarked competing technology? What were our initial assessments of this technology?
* Are we attending conferences or meetups on this technology? Do we have anyone speaking at any of those forums?
* Do we know which companies/competitors are active in this space? (see [TBD]())
